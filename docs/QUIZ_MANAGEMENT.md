# Quiz Management Issue Report

## Overview

This document outlines the issues encountered while managing the quiz functionality in the application. The main problem revolves around the inability to successfully submit a quiz, which results in a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Recent Errors

### 1. SQL Insertion Error

- **Error Message:**
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'type' doesn't have a default value
- **Date:** October 2, 2024
- **User ID:** 1
- **File:** `/var/www/html/internship/lms-metaboussole/app/Http/Controllers/Teacher/QuizController.php`

- **Details:**
This error occurs when attempting to insert a new question into the `questions` table. The specific SQL query that failed is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO `questions` (`question_text`, `quiz_id`, `updated_at`, `created_at`) 
VALUES ('Where?', 25, '2024-10-02 12:09:51', '2024-10-02 12:09:51');
```

### 2. Request Payload

The following data is being sent in the request when submitting the quiz:

```json
{
  "_token": "YUtUlUdkZlG3rZliDdfxtDY7AR1DrHchrA8DfrPb",
  "lesson_id": "66",
  "title": "Quiz example",
  "description": "Creating a quiz with an open-ended question.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "open",
      "text": "Where?",
      "answer_text": "Here"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Undefined Variable Errors

There have been multiple undefined variable errors reported in various views, which may affect overall functionality:

- **Undefined variable `$lesson`**
  - **File:** `/var/www/html/internship/lms-metaboussole/resources/views/student/quizzes/results.blade.php`
  - **Date:** October 1, 2024

- **Undefined constant "localStorage"**
  - **File:** `/var/www/html/internship/lms-metaboussole/resources/views/student/courses/show.blade.php`
  - **Date:** September 23, 2024

## Potential Causes

1. **Database Migration Issues:**  
   The `questions` table does not have a default value for the `type` field, which is mandatory during insertion.

2. **Request Handling:**  
   The request may not include the required `type` field or may be incorrectly formatted.

3. **Code Logic Errors:**  
   Potential logic errors in the `QuizController` that handles the quiz submission process.

## Resolution Suggestions

1. **Update Migration:**  
   Ensure the `questions` table migration includes the `type` field defined as follows:

   ```php
    $table->string('type'); // or $table->string('type')->nullable();
    ```

2. **Modify Request Payload:**  
   Ensure that the request payload includes the `type` field for each question being submitted.

3. **Check Controller Logic:**  
   Review the logic in the `QuizController` to verify that it correctly processes the incoming request data, especially regarding the `questions` array.

4. **Debugging:**  
   Use debugging tools to log the request payload just before the insertion to verify the data being processed.

## Conclusion

These issues need to be resolved to ensure the quiz functionality operates correctly. Further testing and debugging may be necessary to pinpoint any additional underlying issues.
