# Progress Management

The student's progress is currently tracked using the local storage feature. However, the insertion of this progress into the database is not functioning correctly, despite numerous attempts with various code implementations.

The three buttons responsible for changing styles work perfectly; when one of the buttons is clicked, the other two update simultaneously. The main challenge lies in managing the storage of this progress in the database.

## Controller

A `store` method is implemented in the controller located at `app/Http/Controllers/Student/ProgressController.php`, which is intended to handle the progress storage logic.

## JavaScript

The script responsible for tracking and updating progress is placed on line 348 of the following file:

`resources/js/lesson.js`

## Dysfunctional Code

The part of the code that is not functioning as intended is commented in red for easier identification. Further investigation is required to resolve the issue with database insertion.

## Next Steps

To address the issue, consider reviewing the `store` method in the `ProgressController` and verifying the AJAX request to ensure it correctly communicates with the backend.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to write unit tests for the new functionality related to progress management.
- Document any changes made in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- If you encounter any issues or need further clarification, please reach out on the project's issue tracker.

Thank you for addressing these issues!
